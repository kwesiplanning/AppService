                Did you submit a separate ownership certificate and agricultural land declaration with your application?
              
              
              
                The &quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ownership certificate&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot; confirms if you own all or some of the land involved in your application. The &quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;agricultural land declaration&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot; confirms if any of the land is part of an agricultural holding.
                You would have chosen 1 of 4 options, labelled A, B, C or D.

      Did I submit these separately?
    
  
  
    You would have submitted these separately if either:
              
                  your application form did not have an ownership certificate section
                  your local planning department asked for a separate document because of a mistake on your application form
                  you chose to submit a separate ownership certificate section
              
              If you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;re still not sure, you can find your application on the local planning department&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s website.
