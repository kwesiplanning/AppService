      What is a planning obligation?
    
  
  
    A planning obligation is a legal agreement linked to your planning permission. It confirms that you agree to do or not do something if your development goes ahead. This is usually to help manage your development's impact on the area.
        For example, you might agree to:
        donate to a wildlife charity, if your development will affect local wildlife
        help fund improvements to nearby roads, if your development will increase traffic
        only use your garden building as an annexe for family members, instead of a holiday let

      What is a planning obligation?
    
  
  
    A planning obligation is a legal agreement linked to your planning permission. It confirms that you agree to do or not do something if your development goes ahead. This is usually to help manage your development&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s impact on the area.
        For example, you might agree to:
        donate to a wildlife charity, if your development will affect local wildlife
        help fund improvements to nearby roads, if your development will increase traffic
        only use your garden building as an annexe for family members, instead of a holiday let
